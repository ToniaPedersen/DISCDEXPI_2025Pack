# DISC & fPVN Project Data Repository

This GitHub repository contains documents and data for the **DISC** (Digitalization, Industrialization, Standardization Collaboration) and **fPVN** (flexible Production Value Network) communities. The repository includes various datasets, including **DEXPI**, **AutomationML (AML)**, **PDF documents**, and other relevant resources for **data science, research, and application evaluation/development**.

The repository provides data from two **oil and gas fields** on the Norwegian continental shelf:

- **Huldra**: An older platform designed in **1999**, in production from **2001**.
- **Yggdrasil**: Comprising the **Hugin A, Hugin B, and Munin** facilities, currently in the **Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC)** phase. Production is planned for **2027**.

All installations are regulated by the **Sokkeldirektoratet** (Norwegian authorities) and design and operation is to follow **NORSOK** and other relevant national and international standards.
